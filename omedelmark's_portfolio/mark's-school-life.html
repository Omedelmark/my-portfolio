    <h1>About my school life</h1>
    <p>I started school in the year 1996 at st stevens nursery school and after graduating, i went to st Kizito primary school in bugolobi..when i reached p.4, i switched to Goldmax primary school in wakiso where i sat my primary leaving examinations.
        I started high school at kisubi mapeera secondary school on entebbe road in the year 2007 where i studied senior one to senior two.
        I then went to alliance high school in nansana but then ended up at kyere township school in serere for my senior four.
        after senior four, i branched and offered motor vehicle engineering in the year 2011 but did not complete my course.
        i later on joined Kampabits this year and am hoping to excel by the end of the course period.
